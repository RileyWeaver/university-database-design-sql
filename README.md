## 📌 How to Use

1. Open the **ERD (Final Project ERD.PNG)** to understand the database structure.
2. Load the **SQL schema** from `RileyWeaverFinalProject.sql` into your SQL server or tool (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.).
3. Run the provided queries to validate data retrieval and insights.

> You can use tools such as MySQL Workbench, Azure Data Studio, or SQLite Browser.
